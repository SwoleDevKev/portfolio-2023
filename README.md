## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on making the site responsive and looking well accross all devices as I made changes and additions.  

## Optimizations

Used JavaScript to create some more dynamic interactions. Instead of simply using images for my website projects I placed event listeners onto those elements so that when they are hovered over they change to gifs. This is a simple change that I felt would give me an edge as it's not something i've seen done before on other portfolios. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned more about changing the source of image elements using JavaScript to created a better user experience and more lively portfolio. I also learned that I am writing code based on what my final vision of the project is and therfore limiting myself, I should remain open minded and optimize my sites so that making additions are easier.
